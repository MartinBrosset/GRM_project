# GRM_project

In this repo you will find my work for the final project of GRM.
It is about the study of the paper Interactive Multi-label Segmentation of RGB-D Images by Diebold et al. available here : https://cvg.cit.tum.de/_media/spezial/bib/diebold-et-al-ssvm15.pdf 

By cloning the repo you should be able to reproduce the results in the notebook file.
